## PVP Magic - World of Warcraft PvP Toolkit Addon By PrincessLunaFae
My name is Luna Fae Carper, or Princess Luna Fae.
A little background before I go into what this addon does:
I am a transgender female gamer from Phoenix, Arizona, who has always been fascinated and interested in tinkering with technology. I am optimistic about artificial intelligence and emerging technologies.
I started playing Warcraft during Wrath of the Lich King in my high school years and have played ever since.
This will be my first addon I have developed "solo." I am using AI with GitHub Copilot running in my IDE and watching YouTube videos to learn programming as a new skill.
I have also been using Unreal Engine to make maps on Fortnite.
Anyway, that being said, let me introduce you to my first addon for World of Warcraft: PvP Magic.

### What does it do?
PvP Magic is a new PvP addon and a work in progress.

# Currently, it can do the following:
- Welcome the player upon entering the game with their current honor level and an encouraging message to participate in more PvP.
- Slash command for firing the welcome message on demand: "/pvpmagic wt"

# What I hope to work on and have planned, and what it might do in the future:
- Battleground/Arena after-action reports with heatmaps of deaths, captures, and team fights.
- Damage Reports.
- Healer Tracker.
- K/D/A W/L History.
- Unit Frames similar to Battleground Enemies (if I get that good at this).
- Client-side announcer voiceovers.
- Interface and settings panel for tracking/configuring/viewing it all.
- And more! Give me some ideas on GitHub and social media.
